3DNES
==================

3DNES is an NES( Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator for Nintendo 3DS, developed by St4rk and gdkChan. 
The project is on an initial phase. It’s capable of emulating many games( with speed going from great to somewhat slow), 
and already supports some mappers. However, it doesn’t have support for sound yet.
